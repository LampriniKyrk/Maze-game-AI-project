# Maze-game-AI-project
Contains randomly generated maze based game (player vs AI)
The player's goal is to leave from one of the exits that are generated at the eastern side of the maze. 
The AI uses expecti-minimax algorithm to speculate the player's move with the intent to make the best move that will lead towards the player's capture. 
There are several items scattered in the maze's grid which can be used both by the player and the AI agent.
Those items are listed below: 
-book : opponent loses hold item
-sport shoes : +1 moving speed for 5 game rounds
-running shoes : +2 moving speed for 3 game rounds
